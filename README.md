# EquationPlotter

This demonstrates how to plot equations in Java. It also handles resizing the window. There are no gridlines or numbers on the axes.
If these are desired, I could add them, but I recommend instead that you look at the SciOlympics repostitory.

Because I split the equation off into the EQ.java file, you can only plot one equation at a time. If it were inside the for-loop (GraphicsPanel.java line 34) then you could plot more than one equation.

The method GraphicsPanel.java / plotLine() is a leftover from when I was trying to do this with solid lines instead of dots.
